# “This is a good one.”

[Merlin Mann][1] is definitely my favorite podcaster. I've been listening to him for over <s>a decade(!)</s> _fifteen years_, since the original run of You Look Nice Today.

Merlin doesn't make bad stuff. But sometimes, when he hits upon something, he knows right away. It's become a catchphrase: _"This is a good one."_ 

I keep on the lookout for that phrase. And now I've finally put together a list of — as far as I know — all of the podcast episodes it's been said of. These are the good ones. Enjoy.
